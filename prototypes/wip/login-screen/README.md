# Hub sign-in screen

Status: WIP trial. Concept A (card) with the constellation background (v2) is
in the shared theme as `THeme/UnionSuite/Scripts/SignInPage.js`, loaded by the
theme loader on pages with a `SignIn-Container` zone. Not yet documented in the
usage guide.

## Problem

The old sign-in page faded a triangle pattern and the Hub title in, but the
animation was glitchy and jumpy, and the logo, tagline and form never lined up
well side by side. The redesign puts the logo, tagline and form in a single
glass card over an animated background.

## Design (concept A)

- **Card:** one centred frosted panel with the logo, a free-text tagline, a
  fading divider, then the form. Alignment comes from the structure, so any
  logo shape works and the phone layout is the same design.
- **Tagline:** free text set per site (credit, slogan or empty). It wraps to
  at most two lines.
- **Credit:** "Powered by Union Innovation Hub" sits bottom-left, like a
  copyright line, inside the stage's bottom padding so it never overlaps.
- **Form:** visible labels, with the Forgot? link on the label row. The
  native placeholders are hidden.
- **Accent:** highlights (rim, glow, links, focus ring, button, sparks) use
  the theme's `--accent`, falling back to iMIS blue `#2563c4`. The button text
  switches to dark on light accents.

Card light, drawing on dark-glass, neon-edge and textured-glass references:

- **Glass:** clear frosted tint, backdrop blur, a top sheen and a faint
  tiled-SVG grain.
- **Rim:** a 1.5px masked ring with a glass edge. Two accent arcs travel
  around the border every 16s, driven by a registered `--rim-angle`.
- **Neon bloom:** the same arcs as a blurred ring over the edge. The blur is
  on the element and the mask on its pseudo-element, because an element's own
  filter runs before its mask.
- **Glow:** the arcs heavily blurred behind the card, blooming past its edges
  and showing through the glass (0.6 opacity; the neon is 0.75).
- **Pointer:** the rim and surface nearest the pointer light up, fading out
  280px from the card.

Background (constellation, from `ideas/`):

- Seeded stars drift and join when close. Stars near the pointer are drawn
  towards it and linked to it.
- Focusing a field, signing in, or clicking the open background sends a pulse
  through them.
- Only the canvas repaints. It draws at most 1.5× DPR and about 30fps when
  idle, and pauses while the tab is hidden.

Intro: the stars light from the card outwards and each link draws across from
the star that lit first. The glass rises in, the logo un-blurs and settles, the
tagline wipes in from the left, the divider draws out from the centre and the
form rows arrive one at a time, then the glow and neon bloom in. The intro
waits for web fonts and the logo image (capped at 1.2s).

Signing in: sparks (a tight accent glow with a white core) travel along links
towards the card. They start on the Sign In click (or Enter in a field) with a
burst already under way, and carry on while the native code has the button
disabled. If validation stops the request they die out after 0.7s. When
sign-in fails, they stop at once and a ring goes out from the card. The glow
breathes, the neon comes up to full and a sweep crosses the button; the
theme's busy ring is unchanged. The pointer's own pull eases off while signing
in, as the pointer is on the button then.

Tried and dropped: stars relighting in a loop from the corners in, and stars
closing in on the card while signing in.

Reduced motion keeps short fades, stops the travelling light and draws one
static frame of the field.

Backdrop blur over the animated field costs GPU time, so check it on low-end
hardware before production.

## iMIS installation

Nothing goes in the page's head content. The theme loader (`index.js`) loads
`Scripts/SignInPage.js` on the staff sign-in page (`body.HubWrapper-StaffSignIn`)
or any page with a `SignIn-Container` zone. The loader runs before either is
parsed, so its gate waits and loads the file as soon as one appears; on other
pages the file is never requested.

Until the script runs, `zUnionSuite.css` (`US-SIGNIN-PREPAINT`) paints the
sign-in background on `body.HubWrapper-StaffSignIn` and hides the page content,
so the native page never flashes. If the script never arrives, the content
appears after 5s. The background there duplicates the script's; keep them in
step. The sign-in page uses this background in dark mode too.

Expected structure:

- one zone with CSS class `SignIn-Container`, holding in order:
  - the logo CCO: a logo image, then an optional content item with CSS class
    `Tagline`
  - the native Sign In iPart (`.SignInPage`)

Per site, change only the logo image and the Tagline text. Set `CREDIT_NAME` in
`SignInPage.js` to `""` to hide the credit (e.g. on the Hub's own site).

The script injects its own `<style>` and Google Fonts, adds the canvas, neon
element and credit, and restyles the native page. If it is ever loaded on a
page without the zone, it removes itself.

Implementation notes:

- **The zone is the card,** and its wrapper `.ContentItemContainer` is sized to
  it and carries the glow and neon.
- **The glass is `::before`, not the zone.** A backdrop filter on the zone
  would make it the containing block for the MFA modal inside the Sign In
  iPart.
- **Dark mode** paints panels with a solid surface; the script resets them
  inside the card so the form shows the glass.
- **The intro uses transitions.** Removing `hub-signin-intro` from `<html>`
  starts them, so the rim's travel animation is never restarted. A fail-safe
  removes the class after 6s. Hiding is instant (`transition: none` while the
  class is on): the native logo and form can already be painted when the
  class is added, and an animated hide never finished before the reveal.
- **Other rows (e.g. a JS_CSS row) are hidden.** The Sign In hooks are
  delegated, and the neon and credit are re-added after partial postbacks.
- **Signing in is detected from the button's disabled state,** the same signal
  as the theme's busy ring. Credentials are never read.
- **The layout depends on CSS `:has()`** and `color-mix()`.

## Mockup

`v2/index.html` renders the native Sign In markup (trimmed capture) with the
shared theme CSS and the theme loader, exactly as installed. Its controls
switch the accent (theme orange or blue) and the light/dark theme, simulate a
failed or still-loading sign-in (Esc stops it), and replay the intro.
`v2/hub-logo.png` is a copy of the live logo.

Preview: run the `static-node` launch configuration and open
`http://localhost:8778/prototypes/wip/login-screen/v2/`. Opening the file
directly also works. The preview pane holds back animation frames while hidden,
so screenshots taken straight after a load can show the intro's hidden state.

## Maintained files

- `THeme/UnionSuite/Scripts/SignInPage.js`: the sign-in page design
- `THeme/UnionSuite/index.js`: the loader entry (`signin` module)
- `v2/index.html`, `v2/hub-logo.png`: the mockup
- `ideas/`: the background explorations, including the constellation
- `redesign/index.html`, `redesign/redesign.css`, `login.js`: the design mockup
  with concepts A–C (`#card`, `#split`, `#open`) and the original triangle
  field
- `client-logo-example.svg`: fictional client logo
- `index.html`, `login.css`: the first mockup (side-by-side layout with the
  angled rule), kept for reference until the card is approved

The v1 head script (`imis-head.html`, triangle field) is in Git history at
commit 38a4375.

## Open decisions

- Client logos must be a light or reversed version to read on the dark
  background. Decide whether to require one, or offer a plate behind
  full-colour logos.
- Whether the credit also shows on the Hub's own site.
- Document the sign-in design in the usage guide when the trial is approved.
- Retire the first mockup (`index.html`, `login.css`) and the triangle
  `redesign/` concepts to `archive/` once the card is approved.
