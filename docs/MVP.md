# MVP task list

The work left before the theme's MVP. Set by the owner on 14 October 2026.
Day-to-day tasks and live checks stay in [TODO.md](../TODO.md); tick items off
here as each one is finished.

## Taskbar

- [ ] Palette: replace the placeholder entries with the real list.

## Home page

- [ ] Search: go back to the standard CCO search.
- [ ] Needs attention: point the folder at a real folder, not the sandbox.

## Contact layout

- [ ] CloudToolz Query Template: finish it. **Blocks most of the finance
      sections.**
- [ ] Contact IQAs: move them out of the sandbox (list below, under
      [IQAs still in the sandbox](#iqas-still-in-the-sandbox)).
- [ ] Banner: finish it.
  - [ ] Alerts
  - [ ] Delegates
- [ ] Activity timeline: finish it.
- [ ] Participation tab: tidy it up to match the mockup.
- [ ] History / changelog tab: finish it.

Handover and decisions: [contact page v3](../prototypes/wip/contact-page-v3/README.md).

## Cases layout

- [ ] Banner
- [ ] Overview
- [ ] Details
- [ ] Activity
- [ ] Quick actions
- [ ] Composer actions
- [ ] Create case form

Handover: [case page](../prototypes/wip/case-page/HANDOVER.md). Open data
issues (CaseID not reaching the case contacts IQA, ContactType 'Please
Enter') are under Cases in [TODO.md](../TODO.md#cases).

## Agreements layout

- [ ] Review all popups.

Background: [agreement page](../prototypes/wip/agreement-page/README.md).

## IQAs still in the sandbox

Contact, case and agreement IQAs that the repo references in a `SandBox`
folder (found 14 October 2026). Each one needs a production folder. When an IQA
moves, also update every file listed beside it. This list only covers paths
written in the repo. Paths set only in an iPart's settings on the live site
won't appear here, so check each page in iMIS too (IQA designer → Where used).

### Contact

| `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CRM Layouts/Contact Profile/Activity` (folder) | Activity timeline sources (Interactions, Outbound Emails, Outbound Email Resends, Outbound Emails History …): v3 `index.html`, `contact-page.js`, `docs/THEME-ACTIVITY-FEED.md`, `Activity-IQA-Specs.md` |

The banner, staff, notes ledger and parties IQAs are already under
`$/_i4u_/Core/Cases/`.

### Agreements

| Sandbox IQA or folder | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CA/ZenFileTags` | Attachment tag suggestions. **Already in the shipped theme** (`THeme/UnionSuite/zUnionSuite.js`, `US-ATTACHMENTS`). |
| `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CA/Agreement Summary` | Field groups: `Agreement-Field-Groups-Query-Template.html` |
| `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CA/Agreement Details` | Field groups: same template |
| `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CA/Agreement Key Dates` | Field groups: same template |

The other agreement IQAs are already under `$/_i4u_/Core/CA/`. The v1
mock-up (`prototypes/Agreement Management/`) also names
`SandBox/CA/Config - Query Template Definitions` and
`SandBox/CA/Query Template - Manage Agreement - Milestones API`. Check
whether the live page still uses them.

### Also in the sandbox (outside these three layouts)

- Home: `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CRM Layouts/Home_Page/Trackers` (Needs attention,
  see above) and `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CRM Layouts/Home_Page/Stats` (the
  membership stats templates under `usage/templates/Home/Stats/`).
- Taskbar bookmarks: `$/_i4u_/SandBox/CRM Layouts/Jobs List` in
  `Scripts/UnionSuiteTaskbar-Bookmarks.js`.
